#Huffman coding is an algorithm developed in 1952 for data compression. HC is one of the older data compression algorithms, but it is still in use today. Huffman coding is based on the idea that frequently occurring characters are assigned shorter codes, while infrequent characters get longer codes.
#The algorithm is given a vocabulary that specifies how many times a particular symbol appears in the data. Based on this, the algorithm creates a binary tree, where the most frequent characters are closer to the root, and the less frequent characters are further away from the root.
